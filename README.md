# Gem Warrior

Welcome to the land of Jool, where randomized mayhem and fortune are just as likely as the other.

You take up the mantle of Gem, a gifted young acolyte who has been tasked by the queen herself, Ruby, to venture off into the unknown to recapture a Shiny Thing(tm) that holds great power within its crystallized boundaries. Unfortunately, it was stolen recently by a crazed madperson named Emerald, bent on using its frightening power for Evil. You are Good, obviously, and the rightful caretaker of such power, but he will not give it up willingly, and has cursed all the creatures of the land into doing his bidding, which is largely tearing you limb from limb.

Start in your poor, super lame cottage, where you live alone, subsisting off the sale of polished rocks you scavenge all day for in the neighboring caves, and travel throughout the land of Jool, eventually reaching the sky tower that Emerald resides in with his stolen goods, laughing to himself, occasionally. Discover sights and sounds as your trek transpires, all of which are new to you because you don't really get out much. Visit towns with merchants willing to trade coin for wares they bought off of other adventurers who didn't last the trip. Sleep in makeshift huts to regain your health and magic points, which are conveniently located in your peripheral vision (i.e. the console window).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'gemwarrior'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install gemwarrior

## Usage

Just type `gemwarrior` and you'll be whisked away to Jool, ready to start or continue your quest to defeat Emerald and take back the coveted Shiny Thing(tm) that you will return to Queen Ruby (or will you...?).
